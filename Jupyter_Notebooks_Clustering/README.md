# User Signature Clustering for Authentication

This folder contains notebooks that implements unsupervised clustering (KMeans/HDBSCAN) and anomaly detection to classify user RF signatures as authentic or non-authentic.
Features are extracted from physical-layer metrics like SINR, RSRP, and PUSCH SNR over windowed time series data.
